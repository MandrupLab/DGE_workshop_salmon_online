1. We cannot annotate our genes until we know the source and build of the reference files that were used in the analysis upstream of obtaining the pseudocounts.
	
	1. **True**
	1. False

1. Which of the following statements about AnnotationHub are NOT TRUE?

	1. AnnotationHub is a resource for accessing genomic data or querying large collection of whole genome resources, including ENSEMBL, UCSC, ENCODE among many others.
	1. **In AnnotationHub Ensembl and Entrez identifiers have a one-to-one mapping.**
	1. AnnotationHub allows us to retrieve gene, transcript and exon-level information.
	1. When searching Human EnsemblDb using AnnotationHub, there are older releases but only for the most recent build.

1. True/False. Among the functional analysis methods, GSEA is better than over-representation analysis for exploring enriched processes or pathways when there are few differentially expressed genes.

	1. **True**
	1. False

1. True/False. We identify RNA splicing-related terms as significant in both our over-representation and GSEA analyses. We can conclude that RNA splicing is affected by our condition of interest.

	1. True
	1. **False**
