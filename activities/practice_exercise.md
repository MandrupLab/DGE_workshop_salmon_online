Use the Salmon quant files to perform differential gene expression analysis with DESeq2. Report the DE genes identified for SMOC2 over-expressing samples relative to wild type using an FDR threshold of 0.05, by uploading a csv file containing the results table output by DESeq2,but only for the significant genes.

Also generate a heatmap of the top 20 differentially expressed genes and include an annotation bar assigning samples to each group. Upload this heatmap.

e. Use the Salmon output to run Sleuth and identify differentially expressed transcripts. Use Sleuth functions to create a PCA plot. Save and upload the image. How well do samples cluster?
